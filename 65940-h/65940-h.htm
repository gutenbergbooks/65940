<p>At the time of the War Between the States the name of Colonel
Sion S. Bass was well known in Fort Wayne; today few citizens
of the Summit City recall his heroism. Only a bare outline of his
life can be constructed from the meager information available.
Grace Leslie Dickerson, grandniece of the Colonel, assembled
most of the material for this biographical sketch. Supplementary
details were found in the Fort Wayne newspapers of the Civil War
years.</p>
<p>The Boards and the Staff of the Public Library of Fort Wayne
and Allen County gratefully acknowledge the kindness of Mrs.
Dickerson and other members of the Bass family. This biography
is presented in the hope that the life and sacrifice of Colonel Bass,
Civil War hero, will become more familiar to his fellow citizens.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_1">1</div>
<p class="tb">Not many years ago, the Fort Wayne post of the Grand Army
of the Republic was an active organization. Today that post, named
for Sion S. Bass, is no longer in existence. His name, as well as
Civil War terms like Shiloh, United States Volunteers, and Copperhead,
has almost lost its significance for the average citizen.</p>
<p>The honorable causes espoused and defended in the tragic
Civil War were championed by many men of heroic stature&mdash;men
worthy of the unstinted admiration and respect of each succeeding
generation. These were the soldiers who acquitted themselves
honorably in fighting for the causes they believed just. Colonel
Sion St. Clair Bass, a successful young man who could have avoided
military service, was one of the many who gave their lives in the
struggle.</p>
<p>Colonel Bass was born on a farm near Salem, Kentucky, on
January 6, 1827. He was descended from a line of early settlers
in Virginia, the Carolinas, and Kentucky. In 1805, at the age of
three, Sion&rsquo;s father had been taken by his parents from Virginia
to the wilderness of Christian County, Kentucky. Sion&rsquo;s mother,
Jane Todd Bass, who had come with her family from Charleston,
South Carolina, was also an early pioneer in the bluegrass country.
In Kentucky, Sion&rsquo;s father acquired large areas of farmland
and became prominent in local affairs.</p>
<p>The young Sion enjoyed a normal, happy childhood with his
brothers, John and Jerden, and his sister, Emily Jane. The children
helped to till the fields and performed their daily household
chores. Their most exciting diversions were holiday journeys to
nearby Paducah where they could watch the barges and steamboats
on the Ohio and Tennessee rivers. The children were educated in
the schools of Kentucky. Sion, the eldest, later attended Bartlett&rsquo;s
College of Commerce in Cincinnati.</p>
<p>After his graduation in February, 1849, Sion followed his
mother&rsquo;s advice and came to Fort Wayne. Jane Bass believed that
Fort Wayne, already a thriving town, would offer good business
opportunities for her sons because of its favorable location at the
confluence of the three rivers. Chicago, she believed, would soon
grow too large. In Fort Wayne, Sion found employment with the
great western fur traders, Ewing, Chute, and Company, and soon
became a trusted confidential agent of the firm. In this position,
he became acquainted at first hand with the dangers and privations
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
of frontier life.</p>
<p>Very little material can be found concerning his private life
in Fort Wayne. It is recorded, however, that he married Eliza
Bayles, and that they were the parents of two daughters, Georgia
and Beverly. And we do know that the young man was a devout
member of the Episcopal Church.</p>
<p>In 1853 Sion became a member of Jones, Bass, and Company,
which manufactured iron products. In 1857 the firm was sold to
the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne, and Chicago Railroad. In September
of the same year, Sion Bass formed a partnership with William H.
Jones. The partners established a new foundry and machine shop
along the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne, and Chicago Railroad and the
Wabash Railroad. In 1858 a partnership, which had been formed
by Edward Force and Sion&rsquo;s brother John, leased the plant. And
the following year, the plant was sold to the Fort Wayne Machine
Works. The activities of Sion Bass cannot be traced from the completion
of the sale negotiations until the onset of the War Between
the States.</p>
<p>In 1861 the Confederate forces opened fire on Fort Sumter
in Charleston Harbor signaling the outbreak of bitter civil strife.
Drafting of men for military service was not practiced in the United
States at that time; both sides relied upon volunteers to fill their
fighting ranks. Sion Bass found himself in a dilemma; he was torn
between his fond attachment for the South, where he had spent his
childhood and early youth, and his loyalty to the North. Because
of his southern background, many Northerners did not trust him.
Besides, he was the sole breadwinner of his family; his wife and
two children were wholly dependent upon him. He could have refused
to face the issue; he could have continued his daily routine
as a civilian in the North. But his firm conviction of the moral
wrong of slavery and his desire to fight for the Union overcame
all his reservations. In response to President Lincoln&rsquo;s call for
volunteers, he enlisted in the Union Army.</p>
<p>On September 12, 1861, Sion Bass received his appointment
as colonel of the Thirtieth Regiment of Indiana Volunteers, which
was then being recruited. By September 24, the quota for the
regiment had been filled, and the Thirtieth was organized at Camp
Allen in Fort Wayne. Although he was himself untrained for military
service, Colonel Bass entered upon the task of disciplining
and training his raw recruits with such energy and devotion to duty
that he soon won the praise of his superior officers.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>On October 2, the Thirtieth Indiana left Camp Allen and traveled
to Indianapolis by special train on the Wabash Railroad. The
train stopped en route at Peru, Indiana, where the ladies of the
town met the regiment at the depot and provided an excellent dinner.
This act of kindness, although not possible under the strict
army regulations of our day, was typical of the spirit of the times
and was much appreciated by the hungry soldiers.</p>
<p>The Thirtieth remained in camp at Indianapolis only for a
few days. During this time, the men underwent further training;
arms, uniforms, and accouterments were issued to them. The
unit was then ordered to proceed to Kentucky. On October 13, 1861,
the regiment was assigned to the Fifth Brigade, Second Division
in General Don Carlos Buell&rsquo;s Army of the Ohio. For the next few
months Colonel Bass and his Thirtieth Indiana Regiment marched
with Buell&rsquo;s army but saw little action.</p>
<p>The anxiety which his family felt for him is shown in the following
letter written by his mother to her younger son John:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Salem, Lexington County, Kentucky</p>
<p class="t0">November 29, 1861</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Dear Son,</p>
</div>
<p>It is with great pleasure I write you hoping to hear from you
soon, as I have not heard from you for months. I know not where
your brother is. I hope he is not in Columbus. We hear the firing
of cannons every day at Cairo, Columbus, Belmont, and several
other places.</p>
<p>We have had no FORT WAYNE TIMES for two weeks till yesterday.
It gave an account of his being in Nevin, about the center
of the state, where I think he will be killed.</p>
<p>John, could you have no influence over him? Why did he go?
What will become of his little children? Buckner and he will come
in contact with each other soon, and what will be the event? God
only knows. I never expect to see him again.</p>
<p>Richard M. Ford was killed in the Battle of Belmont, six
miles from Columbus. I expect his wife is in Texas. Ford Sterling
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
was killed at Bowling Green. Mr. Pippen died the nineteenth of
November, and you heard of the death of Mr. Barker.</p>
<p>Beverly was here yesterday and says they are all well. Every
person has left Salem except for a few families. Your Pa says,
&ldquo;I have done nothing in no way&rdquo;; and he expects to stay at his home
and do the best he can.</p>
<p>All the ferryboats are sunk, and there is no way to cross
the river. The troops pass through Salem&mdash;the Northerners and
the Southerners. I am afraid of their meeting sometime in Salem.</p>
<p>This may be the last letter you ever will get from me. I
expect the mail will stop. Give my respects to Eliza and the children,
and write often. Let me hear from your brother if you ever
hear again.</p>
<p>I close by saying,</p>
<p><span class="center">Your ever affectionate mother,</span>
<span class="lr">Jane Bass</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In February, 1862, Buell attempted to march his army northward
to reinforce General Grant&rsquo;s Army of the Tennessee in the
attack on Fort Donelson. Adverse weather conditions and impassable
roads forced the men to return to camp after an advance of
only fourteen miles. In March General Buell received orders from
General Halleck to join Grant and the Army of the Tennessee at
Pittsburg Landing near Shiloh. General Grant and his forces were
to remain in camp at Pittsburg Landing while awaiting Buell&rsquo;s arrival.
It was planned that the two armies would join forces and
then advance on Corinth. The delay thus necessitated in the Union
advance afforded the scattered Confederate forces an opportunity
to consolidate their strength. On the sixth of April, under the able
leadership of General Albert Sidney Johnston, the Confederate
troops launched a surprise attack against Grant&rsquo;s encampment.</p>
<p>The roar of cannon could be heard by the men of Buell&rsquo;s advancing
army although they were still many miles distant from the
battlefield. Hour after hour, the men of the Thirtieth followed
their commander southward through swampland to Savannah, Tennessee.
Boats ferried them from that city across the Tennessee
River to Pittsburg Landing. On the morning of the seventh, the
Fifth Brigade, which included Colonel Bass&rsquo;s regiment, was ordered
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
into battle as a replacement for General Rousseau&rsquo;s brigade,
which had undergone murderous fire in defense of the road leading
from the landing to the battlefield. The Thirtieth was engaged in
mortal combat with the enemy. Confederate artillery to the right,
left, and center maintained a continuous fire which inflicted heavy
casualties. Colonel Bass led his regiment into battle and encouraged
the men by his presence. Three times he led them impetuously
against the foe; thrice his men were repelled. Yet at each
command of its gallant Colonel, the Thirtieth again moved forward.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the Colonel&rsquo;s horse was wounded and became almost
unmanageable. Colonel Bass dismounted to examine the
wound. Just as he reached the ground, he was struck in the upper
thigh by a musket ball. Nevertheless, he soothed his horse, remounted,
and continued to fight. He rode calmly among his men
and exhorted them to still greater efforts. But soon he became
faint and could no longer sit in the saddle. The wound was a mortal
one, but death did not come immediately. Colonel Bass was
carried from the battlefield to a Tennessee River steamer and
transported to Paducah, Kentucky. He passed away at St. Mark&rsquo;s
Hospital in that city a week after he had been wounded. His wife,
mother, and brother were present at his bedside.</p>
<p>After news of his death reached Fort Wayne, a meeting was
called at the courthouse for the purpose of paying due honor to his
memory. A committee of fifteen was appointed to meet the remains
at Peru and to act as an escort to Fort Wayne. Mr. W. H.
Withers proposed the following motion which was adopted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;RESOLVED, that while the remains are passing from the
cars to his late residence, and during the funeral ceremonies of
the lamented Colonel Bass, this meeting requests that all secular
business be suspended, that the bells of the city be tolled, that the
flags be hung at half-mast, and that the business houses of the city
be closed during the funeral obsequies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another committee was appointed to draft resolutions expressing
the loss sustained by the country and the community in
the death of Colonel Bass. On April 21, 1862, these resolutions
were published in DAWSON&rsquo;S DAILY TIMES AND UNION:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="923" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Colonel Bass was struck by a musket ball</i>....</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;RESOLVED, That the death of Colonel Sion S. Bass, distinguished
alike for his social qualities, his noble and unselfish
impulses, his stainless morality in private life, and his ability,
humanity, and gallantry as a soldier, is a severe affliction to the
community in which he lived. It is a calamity to the officers and
privates under his command, for their confidence in him as a
leader was equaled only by their love for him as a man. And it is
a heavy loss to the country which he served and to the cause which
he had so heartily espoused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;RESOLVED, That our grief for the death of Colonel Bass
is aggravated by the reflection that perhaps he and thousands of
other Federal soldiers who were slain or wounded in the Battle of
Pittsburg Landing might today be standing with arms in their hands.
They might still be ready to do battle in their country&rsquo;s cause had
it not been for the apparently inexcusable and unparalleled neglect
of the commanding generals in not using those precautions against
a &lsquo;surprise&rsquo; which are always used by trustworthy commanders at
the head of armies in the presence of active and powerful foes.
Courage is only one qualification for a commander; to personal
bravery there should be united military science and skill, vigilance,
prudence, and self-control. Whenever it shall be discovered
that any general in command of Federal forces is deficient in those
indispensable qualifications, it is the imperative duty of the Administration
to relieve him of his command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;RESOLVED, That, as Indiana has given without stint her
noble and cherished sons to the nation to aid in crushing a monstrous
and causeless rebellion, and as their blood has been freely
shed on nearly every battlefield where success has attended the
Federal arms, she has a right to demand and will demand that those
who are still at their posts shall not be unnecessarily sacrificed
through the incompetency or carelessness of commanding generals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;RESOLVED, That the citizens of this county, while they
mourn over the untimely death of Colonel Bass, have the proud
satisfaction of knowing that, although he was born and raised in a
state of doubtful loyalty and although many of his early friends had
joined in the great rebellion against the Constitution and the Union,
his loyalty never faltered. He received his death wound while in
the act of leading his men into the thickest of the fight and while
cheering them on to danger and to victory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;RESOLVED, That, while the death of Colonel Bass is a
deep affliction to all those who knew him, a calamity to the regiment
he so ably commanded, and a heavy loss to the nation in whose
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
service and in whose defense he so gloriously died, it is a terrible
bereavement to his grief-stricken family. We tender to his widow,
to his father and mother, the hearty sympathy of the entire community,
which will ever cherish a fond interest in their welfare
and in the welfare of his orphaned children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;RESOLVED, That the death of such soldiers as Colonel
Bass, who have been slain in the dreadful war into which the government
of the United States has been forced for the preservation
of its existence, indicates the value that should be placed upon our
free institutions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;RESOLVED, That, while lamenting the death of Colonel
Bass and the officers and soldiers under his command who have
fallen in defense of their country and its flag, and while congratulating
the survivors on the reputation they so dearly earned on the
bloody field of Pittsburg Landing, we are not unmindful of our fellow
citizens of the Forty-fourth Regiment, who on that same field
and at Fort Donelson proved their gallantry by deeds and losses
almost unparalleled in modern warfare. We lament, also, their
noble dead. We tender to their wounded and bereaved our sincere
sympathy, and to their fearless and noble Colonel, Hugh B. Reed,
and to the remnant of his regiment which still remains at the post
of danger, our admiration for their valor and our gratitude for
their services.</p>
<p>&ldquo;RESOLVED, That, with the daily accumulating proofs of
the desolation and woe which mark the existence of civil war, we
earnestly invoke the God of love and peace again to dispose the
hearts of all the people of the United States to obedience to lawful
authority, to fidelity to the Constitution and laws, and to the fraternal
love and peace which in other years united them as fellow
citizens and sharers of a once happy and prosperous but now deeply
afflicted country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;RESOLVED, That a copy of this report and these resolutions,
signed by the committee, be delivered to the widow and the
father of the deceased Colonel Bass; and that the same be published
in the newspapers of Fort Wayne and of the Tenth Congressional
District of Indiana.</p>

<p>Colonel Bass had won the confidence, love, and admiration
of the people of his adopted city. The tragedy of his death was felt
by the entire populace. An excerpt from DAWSON&rsquo;S DAILY TIMES
AND UNION, published on April 18, 1862, describes the arrival
of the funeral train in the city:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The remains of Colonel Sion S. Bass reached here today at
eleven o&rsquo;clock over the Toledo and Western Railway. The committee
in charge was sent from here and met the train at Huntington.
A large concourse of people was at the depot to pay that mark
of respect due their late fellow citizen. The coffin and hearse
were properly decorated with the national colors. When the funeral
cortege moved, guns were fired, bells tolled, and drums beat.
The procession came down Calhoun Street to Wayne Street, and
then turned in the direction of his residence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was interred in Lindenwood Cemetery on the following
day. His final resting place is marked by a sandstone monument
which bears the following inscription:</p>
<p class="center">IN MEMORY OF
<br />SION S. BASS
<br />COL. OF 30TH REG&rsquo;T. IND. VOL.
<br />BORN AT SALEM, LIVINGSTON CO. KY.
<br />JAN&rsquo;Y 6, 1827:
<br />DIED AT PADUCAH, KENTUCKY,
<br />APRIL 14, 1862,
<br />OF WOUNDS RECEIVED
<br />WHILE GALLANTLY LEADING HIS REGIMENT
<br />AT THE BATTLE OF SHILOH,
<br />APRIL 7, 1862

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
